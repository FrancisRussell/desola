- See if binaries can be made smaller (maybe too much inlining or template independent code inside templated classes).
- Make updating dependency information for expression nodes more efficient (especially important for ElementSet node).
- Make Vector and Matrix classes use the same ElementSet node for multiple setting of elements.
- Implement sparse matrices.
