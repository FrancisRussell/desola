This is the source for the prototype numerical library
developed as part of my (Francis Russell) final year
project at Imperial College London.

In order to compile, it requires:

- Boost
- The modified TaskGraph distribution distributed with this project.
- The Matrix Template Library (optional)

Headers for the ITL set of iterative solvers are already included in the
package.
